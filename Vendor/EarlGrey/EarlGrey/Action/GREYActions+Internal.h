/**
 *  Use the iOS keyboard to type a string starting from the provided UITextPosition. If the
 *  position is @c nil, then type text from the text input's current position. Should only be called
 *  with a position if element conforms to the UITextInput protocol - which it should if you
 *  derived the UITextPosition from the element.
 *
 *  @param text     The text to be typed.
 *  @param position The position in the text field at which the text is to be typed.
 *
 *  @return @c YES if the action succeeded, else @c NO. If an action returns @c NO, it does not
 *          mean that the action was not performed at all but somewhere during the action execution
 *          the error occurred and so the UI may be in an unrecoverable state.
 *
 *  @remark This is available only for internal testing purposes.
