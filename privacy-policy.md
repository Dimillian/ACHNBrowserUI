# AC Helper privacy policy

We do not collect any of your data. The only data collected is collected from within the app itself and only stored locally. It's your items list, caught insects, fishes etc....

We don't display any ads or send anything to any server. So we don't track you using an advertising identifier or anything of the sort. 

Thanks a lot for using AC Helper, and we hope you're happy with it. If you have any issues to report or feedback to make about this privacy policy or anything else, you can do it using Github issues on our repository.
