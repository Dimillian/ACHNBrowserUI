## Credits

This is just a very simple SwiftUI application, all the database hard work have been done on the [master sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hxrdp7oxtK-J5x9u1-rzChUpLtkv3t0_kNGdS6dtyWI/edit#gid=2031086626) by the community. 

And [u/Azarro](https://www.reddit.com/user/Azarro/) made an awesome JSON API from that google sheet. (private for now).

As the API is private the app use a local dump of the API at the moment.
