## Credits

This is just a very simple SwiftUI application, all the database hard work have been done on the [master sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hxrdp7oxtK-J5x9u1-rzChUpLtkv3t0_kNGdS6dtyWI/edit#gid=2031086626) by the community. 

And [u/Azarro](https://www.reddit.com/user/Azarro/) made an awesome JSON API from that google sheet. (private for now).

As the API is private the app use a local dump of the API at the moment. 

Thanks to [Turnip.exchange](https://turnip.exchange/) for the turnips exchange API.

Thanks to [ACNH API](http://acnhapi.com/) for the API that allow us to display villagers and their icons/images.
